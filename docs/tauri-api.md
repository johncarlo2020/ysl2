# Tauri NFC API

Send `Accept: application/json` and `Content-Type: application/json`.

## Login

`POST /api/admin/login`

```json
{"email":"admin@example.com","password":"your-password","device_name":"NFC desktop"}
```

Returns `token`, `token_type`, `expires_at`, and `user`. Token expires after 24 hours. Admin accounts and configured staff accounts can log in. Login and the current-user endpoint include `role`, `staff_function` (`register` or `station`), and `station_id`. Invalid credentials return 422; excessive login attempts return 429.

For all endpoints below send `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.

| Method | Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GET | /api/admin/user | Current signed-in admin, under `data` |
| GET | /api/admin/users | Paginated attendees, excluding admins and staff |
| GET | /api/admin/users/by-rfid?rfid_uid=04A1B2C3D4 | Attendee details for an RFID card, under `data` |
| GET | /api/admin/users/{id} | One assignment user, under `data` |
| PUT | /api/admin/users/{id}/nfc | Assign or replace NFC UID |
| DELETE | /api/admin/users/{id}/nfc | Unassign NFC card (no request body) |
| POST | /api/admin/logout | Revoke current token |
| GET | /api/admin/stations | Stations ordered by ID, under `data` (ID, name, description) |
| POST | /api/admin/stations/check-in | Check in an assigned NFC card at a station |

List parameters: `without_nfc=1`, `search` (mobile number, exact ID, or exact RFID UID), `per_page` (1–100, default 25), and `page`. Pagination response includes `data`, `current_page`, `last_page`, and `total`.

User fields: `id`, `email`, `code`, `mobile_number`, `rfid_uid`. Registration stores the mobile number in `code`; older records may contain a legacy registration code.

Assignment body:

```json
{"rfid_uid":"04A1B2C3D4"}
```

Use the same UID representation as the existing card reader. Duplicate UIDs return 422. Missing/expired tokens return 401; accounts without admin access return 403. Admin and staff accounts cannot be assignment targets (404).

The existing `/api/users/without-nfc` shared-secret endpoint remains available for existing integrations. The desktop app can use `/api/admin/users?without_nfc=1` with its login token instead.

## RFID user lookup

`GET /api/admin/users/by-rfid?rfid_uid=04A1B2C3D4`

Send `Accept: application/json` and `Authorization: Bearer <token>` using the token from login. Admins, registration staff, and station staff can look up an attendee's assigned card. This request does not check in the attendee or change the card assignment.

Example response (HTTP 200):

```json
{
  "data": {
    "id": 123,
    "email": "attendee@example.com",
    "code": "+639171234567",
    "mobile_number": "+639171234567",
    "rfid_uid": "04A1B2C3D4",
    "role": "client",
    "staff_function": null,
    "station_id": null
  }
}
```

The UID must be a nonempty string of at most 64 characters; surrounding whitespace is trimmed. Use the same UID representation as card assignment, preserving leading zeros. Invalid or missing UIDs return 422. Unknown, unassigned, admin, or staff cards return 404. Missing/expired tokens return 401; unauthorized accounts or tokens without `nfc:manage` return 403. Passwords and authentication tokens are never included in the user details.

## Station check-in

Load the station selector from `GET /api/admin/stations`. Send the selected station ID and captured card UID:

```json
{"station_id":1,"rfid_uid":"04A1B2C3D4"}
```

`POST /api/admin/stations/check-in` uses the same bearer token as card assignment and the same rules as the web kiosk. A successful check-in returns HTTP 200 with `status: "success"` and `message: "Station checked in successfully"`. A repeat tap returns HTTP 200 with `status: "duplicate"` and does not create another record. Unknown cards return 404 with `status: "error"`; invalid fields return 422 with validation errors. Admin and staff cards are not check-in targets (404).

Station 4 requires completed check-ins at stations 1, 2, and 3; otherwise it returns 422 with `status: "prerequisites_not_met"`. Successful station 4 redemption clears the card assignment so the card can be reused. A subsequent tap of that cleared card returns 404 until it is assigned again. Check-ins record elapsed time using the previous check-in (or last login/registration for the first station) and broadcast the existing attendee confirmation event.

Disable repeat submission while a tap is being processed. Inspect `status` even on HTTP 200, and show the returned message beside the reader controls. A server error returns 500; avoid claiming success or automatically retrying a gift redemption when the outcome is uncertain.

## Staff access

Existing `/api/admin/*` paths serve the Tauri app for both admins and staff. Login selects the staff function from the account; the app does not submit a function to grant access.

| Account | Access |
| --- | --- |
| Admin | All existing NFC endpoints |
| Register staff | Current user, attendee search/details, link, unlink, logout |
| Station staff | Current user, RFID attendee lookup, assigned station, station check-in, logout |

Station staff send only `{"rfid_uid":"04A1B2C3D4"}` when checking in. The server supplies the account's station ID. If a different `station_id` is supplied, the request returns 403. Their station list contains only the assigned station. Admin check-ins still require `station_id`. Unauthorized functions return 403. Staff with an invalid function or missing station configuration cannot log in or use existing tokens.

## Create Tauri staff accounts

Run the migration, ensure station IDs 1–4 exist, then run the separate seeder:

```sh
php artisan migrate
# Set TAURI_STAFF_PASSWORD in your environment or .env (at least 12 characters).
php artisan db:seed --class=TauriStaffSeeder
```

| Email | Function | Station |
| --- | --- | --- |
| registration1@staff.ysl.local | register | — |
| registration2@staff.ysl.local | register | — |
| station1@staff.ysl.local | station | 1 |
| station2@staff.ysl.local | station | 2 |
| station3@staff.ysl.local | station | 3 |
| station4@staff.ysl.local | station | 4 |

New accounts receive the hashed `TAURI_STAFF_PASSWORD`. Rerunning the seeder preserves passwords and restores the listed function/station assignments. The seeder is separate from the default database seed operation.
